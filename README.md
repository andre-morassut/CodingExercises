# CodingExercises

All my answers to CodinGame, LeetCode, etc. coding exercices.

### Disclaimer
* The answers I share are merely what I thought to be the best compromise between readability, performance, maintenability, extensibility and the problem goal. They are not the _best_ answers, far from it, they are just mine.
* Answers are not set in stone, I will surely modify some past answers if I deem it necessary.
* All my answers pass 100% of the unit tests provided with the exercise, at the resolution date of course
* In some exercices, I've added alternative solutions from other persons (with credits). If you are the author of one of these programs and want me to remove it, just let me know at andre.morassut@gmail.com.

_Note: In the CodinGame exercises, the markdown filename is the url of the game at the time I resolved it (e.g. `XYZ.md` corresponds to `https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/XYZ`)_
