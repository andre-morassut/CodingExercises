# CodingExercises

All my answers to CodinGame, LeetCode, etc. coding exercices.

### Disclaimer
* The answers I share are merely what I thought to be the best compromise between readability, performance, maintenability, extensibility and the problem goal. They are not the _best_ answers, far from it, they are just mine.
* Answers are not set in stone, I will surely modify some past answers if I deem it necessary.
* All my answers pass 100% of the unit tests provided with the exercise, at the resolution date of course
