# Monday Tuesday Happy Days

## Description

Level : easy

### Goal

Given a start date with a known week day, your program must compute the day of the week at another date anytime in the same year.

**Input**
* __Line 1:__ whether or not the year is a leap year: 1 if it is, 0 otherwise. A leap year is a year when February has 29 days instead of 28. The actual year itself is not given.
* __Line 2:__ the initial date formatted as day of the week abbreviated month day in month, e.g. Monday Apr 23 for April 23rd.
* __Line 3:__ the date you must give the day of the week for, formatted as abbreviated month day in month, e.g. Apr 24 for April 24th.

The abbreviated month names are `Jan`, `Feb`, `Mar`, `Apr`, `May`, `Jun`, `Jul`, `Aug`, `Sep`, `Oct`, `Nov` and `Dec`.

**Output**

* __Line 1:__ The day of the week for the second date: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday or Sunday.

**Constraints**
```
Both dates are always within the same year.
Both dates are validâ€”there is no Jan 45, Feb 29 on non-leap years, etc.
The second date may be before the first one.
